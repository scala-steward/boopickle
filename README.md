BooPickle is the [fastest](http://ochrons.github.io/boopickle-perftest/) and most size efficient serialization (aka pickling) library that works on both Scala
and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org). It encodes into a binary format instead of the more customary JSON. A binary format brings efficiency
gains in both size and speed, at the cost of legibility of the encoded data. BooPickle borrows heavily from both [uPickle](https://github.com/lihaoyi/upickle-pprint)
and [Prickle](https://github.com/benhutchison/prickle) so special thanks to Li Haoyi and Ben Hutchison for those two great libraries!

## Features

- Supports both Scala, Scala Native and Scala.js (no reflection!)
- Serialization support for all primitives, collections, options, tuples and case classes (including class hierarchies)
- User-definable custom serializers
- Transforming serializers to simplify serializing non-case classes
- Handles references and deduplication of identical objects
- Very fast
- Very efficient coding
- Low memory usage, no intermediate structures needed
- Zero dependencies
- Scala 2.12/2.13
- All modern browsers are supported (not IE9 and below, though)

## Getting started

Add following dependency declaration to your Scala project

```scala
"io.suzaku" %% "boopickle" % "1.5.0-M1"
```

On a Scala.js / Scala Native project the dependency looks like this

```scala
"io.suzaku" %%% "boopickle" % "1.5.0-M1"
```

To use it in your code, simply import the Default object contents. All examples in this document assume this import is present.

```scala
import boopickle.Default._
```

To serialize (pickle) something, just call `Pickle.intoBytes` with your data. This will produce a binary `ByteBuffer` containing an encoded version
of your data.

```scala
val data = Seq("Hello", "World!")
val buf = Pickle.intoBytes(data)
```

And to deserialize (unpickle) the buffer, call `Unpickle.fromBytes`, specifying the type of your data. BooPickle doesn't encode *any* type information,
so you *must* use the same types when pickling and unpickling.

```scala
val helloWorld = Unpickle[Seq[String]].fromBytes(buf)
```
